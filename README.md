# Chirp_Classifier
Attempting to build a Machine Learning Model that can classify birds based on their songs/chirping.

This modell uses the British Bird Song Dataset by Rachael Tatman and Dan Stowell.
These recordings were collected by 68 separate birding enthusiasts and uploaded to and stored by xeno-canto: www.xeno-canto.org.
